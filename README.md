# Outdoor 16-channel interactive sound and light installation
The goal was to create a system for an interactive outdoor installation. When a participant grabs an object at the trail entrance, sound and light start to follow him. When this person moves around and looks into the forest, an seperate sound recording follows independently of these movements.
